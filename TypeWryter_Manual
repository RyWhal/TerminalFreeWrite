Welcome to TypeWryter; 

A simple, distraction free, writing tool. It's remeniscent of using a type writer, hence the name. 
Removing most tools for editing forces you to focus on free-writing and making progress with whatever you might be 
writing. 

Global Controls: 
    'esc' or 'CTRL+E' will always escape you back to the previous screen.


While TypeWryting:
    CTRL+N - Rename the file you're currently working on (Default name is the date/time the file was created)
    CTRL+BACKSPACE - Delete the previous word (not implemented yet)
    CTRL+SHIFT+BACKSPACE - Delete the entire current line of text (not implemented yet)
    CTRL+E - Exit the TypeWryter window
    ESC - Exit the TypeWryter window


Saving:
While TypeWryting the open file will auto save, overwriting whatever you had, every 30 seconds. It will also 
auto-save on a proper exit (ESC or CTRL+E). There is NO VERSIONING; only the most current save is kept. 
If you delete, overwrite, or erase something, its GONE.
