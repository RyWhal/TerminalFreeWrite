A simple, distraction free, writing tool. It's remeniscent of using a type writer, hence the name. 
Removing most tools for editing forces you to focus on free-writing and making progress with whatever you might be 
writing. 

Global Controls: 
    'esc' or 'CTRL+E' will always escape you back to the previous screen.


While TypeWryting:
    CTRL+N - Rename the file you're currently working on (Default name is the date/time the file was created)
    CTRL+W - Delete the previous word
    CTRL+L - Delete the entire current line of text
    CTRL+E - Exit the TypeWryter window (current file is saved on exit)
    ESC - Exit the TypeWryter window (current file is saved on exit)


File Manager:
    List Files - shows all saved files (Filename | Created Date | Modified Date | Size on Disk | Word Count)
    Rename - Rename any TypeWryte
    Delete - Delete any TypeWryte
    Clean-up - Deletes all TypeWrytes with a size of 0

Saving:
    While TypeWryting the open file will auto save, overwriting whatever you had, every 60 seconds. It will also 
    auto-save on a proper exit (ESC or CTRL+E). There is NO VERSIONING; only the most current save is kept. 
    If you delete, overwrite, or erase something, its GONE.
